# MMD-Render-WebGL-Three.js
[beta] Render/ open .pmx | zip file use ThreeJs + JSZip.
- (I code for fun)
- This page maybe hard to use I will add "how to use" later
- To open pmx in zip: file -> Open zip (to model) or (to map) -> select file (use window.showOpenFilePicker | input file)
- First is model file, second is camera file, third is dance file, fourth is background file
- Click to file name and click "<" to select it (or double click to fast select), after select click "load all" and wait
- Defect: using it on mobile is quite difficult (fix later)
- +Some model error or not displayed properly, colors are pale
